    -- You can receive this error in two cases:
    --
    -- 1. __If you solve token-based captchas (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, ArkoseLabs FunCaptcha, GeeTest, etc):__
    -- the queue of your captchas that are not distributed to workers is too long.
    -- Queue limit changes dynamically and depends on total amount of captchas awaiting solution and usually itâ€™s between 50 and 100 captchas.
    --
    -- 2. __If you solve Normal Captcha:__ your maximum rate for normal captchas is lower than current rate on the server.
    -- You can change your maximum rate in <https://2captcha.com/setting your account's settings.>

    Error1002
  | -- |
    -- You received the error 'NoSlotAvailable' because you are uploading many captchas and server has a long queue of your captchas that are not distributed to workers.
    -- You received three times more errors than amount of captchas you sent (but not less than 120 errors). Increase the timeout if you see this error.
    --
    -- Blocking time: 30 seconds.
    Error1003
  | -- | Your IP address is blocked because there were 5 requests with incorrect API key from your IP.
    Error1004
  | -- |
    -- You are making too many requests to res.php to get answers.
    --
    --
    -- 2captcha uses the following rule to block your account: R > C * 20 + 1200
    --
    -- Where:
    --
    -- * R - the amount of your requests
    --
    -- * C - the amount of captchas you've uploaded
    --
    -- That means that you don't have to make more than 20 requests to res.php per each captcha.
    -- Please remember that balance request sent to res.php also counts!
    --
    -- To get your answer faster without a risk to be blocked you can use <https://2captcha.com/2captcha-api#pingback pingback> feature and 2captcha will send you the answer when your captcha is solved.
    --
    -- Blocking time: 10 minutes.
    Error1005
  | -- |
    -- The error code is returned if some required parameters are missing in your request or the values have incorrect format.
    -- For example if you submit <https://2captcha.com/2captcha-api#grid Grid images> but your request is missing an instruction for workers.
    --
    -- Blocking time: 5 minutes.
    BadParameters
